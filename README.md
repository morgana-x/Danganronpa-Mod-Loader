# Danganronpa-Mod-Loader
A very basic but very "effective" mod loader for the PC ports of Danganronpa 1&amp;2

Currently uses WAD file related code from [DRAT](https://github.com/Liquid-S/Danganronpa-Another-Tool)

(To be changed)
# Usage
The configuration files and mod folders by default regardless of where you run this program will be located in My Documents/Danganronpa2

There you will find (after initally running the program) a mods folder, and a modConfig.json

inside the mods folder a mod's (current and probably going to change) format is:
A folder with the file's name
Then the data for the mod (which ignores specific wad files as it's all chucked in dr2_keyboard_us.wad essentially)

Example of a really basic layout for a script mod:

My Documents/Danganronpa2/mods/myCoolMod/Dr2/data/us/script/e01_001_100.lin
